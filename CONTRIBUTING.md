# You would like to contribute ?
It's good to hear that you would like to expand this Repo.
But there are a view rules I have on here.

* This is not a repo to submit your Cogs to. Feel free to leave suggestions at the [CogBoard](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Cog-Board/issues).
* Changes should be useful for everyone not just for you.
* The Repo is following the pep8 styleguide this is not forced onto Pull Request but your Pull Request will be formed to comply with that.
