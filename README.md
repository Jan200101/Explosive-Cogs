# Explosive-Cogs

## DISCLAIMER
this repository was used for the now defunct [Red-Discordbot Version 2](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/develop) and contains a bunch of code hastily slaped together.
In 2017 I decided no more and discontinued my cogs to explore other things, taking down my repositories with me to make sure no one would fall victim to my shotty code.
As for March 2019 [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs) and [Explosive-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs) are both back on github with most of their original git history preserved

This is [Sentry](https://github.com/Jan200101)'s current Repo and the successor to [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs).

Some Cogs from [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs) will get a remake in this Repo the currently remade ones are:
 - Terminal now BetterTerminal
 - Embedsay now EmbedNotification
 - ChannnelInfo is still ChannelInfo
 - GCalendar is a revived version of CSGOPlaytest made to work on a standalone basis

These cogs were made for the [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) and may not work with other bots or Version 3 of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).

Feel free to fork this repo to get it working on other bots.

For more useful visit [cogs.red](http://cogs.red/) or go on the list of [Approved Repos](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_cog_approved_repos/)

A Version 3 Rewrite is inbound sooner then later but keep in mind that I dont intend on doing so before V3 is officialy out
