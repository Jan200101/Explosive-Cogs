[![Current Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs)

This is [Sentry](https://github.com/Jan200101)'s current Repo and the successor to [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs).

Some Cogs from [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs) will get a remake in this Repo the currently remade ones are:
 - Terminal now BetterTerminal
 - Embedsay now EmbedNotification
 - ChannnelInfo is still ChannelInfo
 - GCalendar is a revived version of CSGOPlaytest made to work on a standalone basis

These cogs were made for the [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) and may not work with other bots or Version 3 of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).

Feel free to fork this repo to get it working on other bots.

A Version 3 Rewrite is inbound sooner then later but keep in mind that I dont intend on doing so before V3 is officialy out
